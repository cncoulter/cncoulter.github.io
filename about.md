## Longer, first-person bio

I grew up in Southern California and went to college at Santa Clara University, where I studied Theatre Arts and Women's & Gender Studies. After college, I did a year of service with the Jesuit Volunteer Corps in Baltimore, MD, and I then spent two years living and working in a community of adults with and without developmental disabilities in the Kansas City metro area. I currently teach in Jilin City, China.

I write fiction, usually shortish fiction, usually science fiction or fantasy. I write and perform poetry, usually either performance/slam poetry or SF poetry. I also write nonfiction, usually in the form of short fiction reviews.

I'm writer, poet, and aspiring scholar who thinks incessantly about gender, intentional communities, and social justice. I'm a member of the Science Fiction and Fantasy Poetry Association ([SFPA](http://sfpoetry.com/)), and you should [join](http://sfpoetry.com/join.html) too. I'm also an amateur GNU/Linux systems administrator, a big fan of [Free Software](https://www.fsf.org/about/what-is-free-software), and a sinophile who studies Mandarin Chinese.

I love science fiction and intentional communities. I like cooking, religion, podcasts, critical theory, and hiking. I think copyright law is fascinating. I also like to tap dance.
