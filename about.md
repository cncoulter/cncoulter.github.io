## Longer, first-person bio

I grew up in Southern California and went to college at Santa Clara University, where I studied Theatre Arts and Women's & Gender Studies. After college, I did a year of service with the Jesuit Volunteer Corps in Baltimore, MD. I currently live and work in a community of adults with and without developmental disabilities in the Kansas City metro area.

I write fiction, usually shortish fiction, usually science fiction or fantasy. I also write and perform poetry, usually either performance/slam poetry or SF poetry.

I'm a member of the Science Fiction and Fantasy Poetry Association ([SFPA](http://sfpoetry.com/)), and you should [join](http://sfpoetry.com/join.html) too. I'm also an amateur GNU/Linux systems administrator, a big fan of [Free Software](https://www.fsf.org/about/what-is-free-software), and a sinophile who studies Mandarin Chinese.

I love science fiction and intentional communities. I like cooking, religion, podcasts, critical theory, and hiking. I think copyright law is fascinating.
