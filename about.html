            <h2>Longer, first-person bio</h2>

            <p>I grew up in southern California and went to college at Santa Clara University, where I studied Theatre Arts and Women's & Gender Studies. After college, I did a year of service with the Jesuit Volunteer Corps in Baltimore, MD, and I
                then spent two years living and working in a community of adults with and without developmental disabilities in the Kansas City metro area. I currently teach in Jilin City, China.</p>

            <p>I write fiction, usually shortish fiction, usually science fiction or fantasy. I write and perform poetry, usually either performance/slam poetry or SF poetry. I also write nonfiction, including short fiction reviews, blog posts, and
                other essays.</p>

            <p>I'm a member of the Science Fiction and Fantasy Poetry Association (<a href="http://sfpoetry.com/">SFPA</a>), and
                you should <a href="http://sfpoetry.com/join.html">join</a> too. I'm a sinophile who studies Mandarin Chinese. I'm also a GNU/Linux user, a big fan of <a href="https://www.fsf.org/about/what-is-free-software">Free Software</a>, a
                supporter of the <a href="https://sfconservancy.org/supporter/">Software Freedom Conservancy</a>, an amateur sysadmin, and an middling web/ebook designer.</p>

            <p>I love science fiction and intentional communities. I like cooking, religion, podcasts, critical theory, and hiking. I think copyright law is fascinating. I also like to tap dance.</p>
