## 100 Days of A11y

Inspired by [Amy Carney's 100 Days of A11y blog](https://100daysofa11y.com/), I have decided to blog my way through the <abbr title="Certified Professional in Accessibility Core Competences">CPACC</abbr> body of knowledge as I study to become a [Certified Professional in Accessibility Core Competencies](https://www.accessibilityassociation.org/cpacccertification) (CPACC). I plan to write and publish new blog posts once or twice a week as I study for the CPACC exam.
