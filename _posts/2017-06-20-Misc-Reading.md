***Use of Weapons* by Iain M. Banks. Orbit Books, 2008. Originally published in 1990.**

Amazing, awesome world. Beautiful structure. Fun plot. Dull prose.

*Use of Weapons* is the third book in Iain M. Banks' Culture series. The series can be read in any order. This is the third book I've read in the series, and it does the best job of introducing the reader to the marvelous world that Banks has constructed. My favorite book in Banks' Culture series remains the first one that I read, *Excession*. That one was a bit more interesting, a bit more fun, and a bit less accessible.

Banks' prose can be annoyingly over-descriptive at times, but his stories are fun, they're filled with awe, and they feature top-rate world building. I would love to live in the Culture that his series portrays. It's arguably a utopia, it's unlike anything else I've ever read, and I think everyone should read at least one of Bank's Culture works to envision the world he crafts.

***All Systems Red* by Martha Wells. Tor.com, 2017. <http://publishing.tor.com/allsystemsred-marthawells/9780765397522/>**

I'm normally not one for reading books on impulse (my reading list is far too long), but I stumbled upon this book in the library and went for it. I am glad it did.

In *All Systems Red* by Martha Wells,
