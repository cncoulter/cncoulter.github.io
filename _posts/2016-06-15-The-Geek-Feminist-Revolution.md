***The Geek Feminist Revolution* by Kameron Hurley. New York: Tor Books, 2016.**

*The Geek Feminist Revolution* is a collection of essays by speculative fiction writer Kameron Hurley. The essays examine writing careers, pop culture, sexism, racism, the responsibilities of those crafting stories and narratives, and even getting diabetes while living without health insurance. The collection has an introduction, an epilogue, and four divisions: Level Up, Geek, Let’s Get Personal, and Revolution.

It’s a great book. Just go read it. I stormed through it in a week and found myself trying to sell it to a good handful of my friends.

I started following Kameron Hurley’s blog a couple months back, and I found myself excited to read every new blog post. Hurley is funny, inspires me to be a better and more committed writer, and makes me re-think how we construct narratives. So when I saw that she had a new book of essays coming out, I couldn’t really resist—despite already having too many things on my reading list. I made the time for *The Geek Feminist Revolution*. I couldn’t not. And once I started, I couldn’t put it down.

It’s a great book. Just go read it.
