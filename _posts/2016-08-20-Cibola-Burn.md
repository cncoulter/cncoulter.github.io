***Cibola Burn* by James S. A. Corey. New York: Orbit, 2015. Originally published in June 2014.**

*Cibola Burn* is the fourth book in *The Expanse* series by James S. A. Corey, the pen name for Daniel Abraham and Ty Franck. After reading *Cibola Burn*, it’s official: *The Expanse* is the most fun reading I’ve ever done—including *Harry Potter*.

*The Expanse* tells the story of humanity 200 years in the future. We’ve colonized the solar system, and we’re just starting to reach beyond it. It’s a space opera that wraps action, adventure, mystery, horror, and political intrigue all around great human characters.

*Cibola Burn* wasn’t my favorite book in the series, but I still greatly enjoyed it. I enjoyed all the point-of-view characters, I found the character’s problems to be interesting, and the pacing felt just right. It had smaller stakes than the first three books in the series, but since I loved all the characters, I didn’t mind; I was sufficiently invested. In contrast, while I loved the drama and conflict of the previous book, *Abaddon’s Gate*, I didn’t care for one of the POV characters and the last fourth of the book felt overly grueling.

This series is stupendously fun. I highly recommend to all. Go start with the first book in the series: *Leviathan Wakes*. You’re in for a treat. Also, check out the TV series adaptation; season one of *The Expanse* premiered on Syfy this last December. It was awesome.

Oh, and be warned: these books are binge reads. They will demand it.
