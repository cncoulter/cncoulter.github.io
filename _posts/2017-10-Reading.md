***Tranny: Confessions of Punk Rock's Most Infamous Anarchist Sellout* by Laura Jane Grace with Dan Ozzi. Hachette Books, 2016.**

Laura Jane Grace is the frontwoman for the punk rock band *Against Me!*. *Against Me!* is a great band, and *Tranny* is a great book.

There are two primary intersecting storylines that the book follows: Laura dealing with being transgender, and the band's journey from being little-known DIY punks to signing with a major record label and beyond. Both of those journeys are fascinating and emotionally compelling. As someone who has not read much about transgenderism, the music industry, or punk rock music specifically, I found *Tranny* to be an accessible and gripping introduction to all of those topics. And if you are familiar with either transgenderism or puck rock music, I doubt you've encountered these two subjects tied up together before in the unique way that they are in Laura Jane Grace's life.

Moreover, this was just a fun read that gave me more insights into a band I like. It makes me want to read more about bands and the music industry.

I strongly recommend this book to everyone.
