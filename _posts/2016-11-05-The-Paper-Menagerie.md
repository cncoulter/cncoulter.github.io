All in all, a fantastic collection. I recommend to all without reservation.

This collection showcases Liuâ€™s strength and versatility as a writer of short fiction. The Paper Menagerie does a masterful job engaging and negotiating between fantasy and science fiction, and between Eastern and Western culture. Liu also experiments with form a fair deal; this is always interesting and well-done, but sometimes you get a story without a plot. Fortunately, only a few pages later, you will be in the middle of a fantastic story with a plot. So no harm done really, and the experimentations with form are inventive and enjoyable.

Highlights:

* The Perfect Match
* Good Hunting
* The Regular
* The Paper Menagerie
* All the Flavors
* The Litigation Master and the Monkey King
