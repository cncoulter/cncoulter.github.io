***Use of Weapons* by Iain M. Banks. Orbit Books, 2008. Originally published in 1990.**

Some example text.

***Binti: Home* by Nnedi Okorafor. Tor.com, 2017. <http://publishing.tor.com/bintihome-nnediokorafor/9780765393104/>**

I loved this. It was short and satisfying. It's the sequel to *Binti*, which won a Nebula and a Hugo Award, and which I [read]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2016-08-20-Binti %}) this past summer.
