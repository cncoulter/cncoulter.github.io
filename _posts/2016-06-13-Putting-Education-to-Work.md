***Putting Education to Work: How Cristo Rey High Schools Are Transforming Urban Education* by Megan Sweas. New York: HarperOne, 2014.**

Before I started my year of service at Cristo Rey Jesuit High School in Baltimore, I read *More Than a Dream: The Cristo Rey Story* by G. R. Kearney, which tells the story of the first Cristo Rey school in Chicago. I found the book to be detailed, interesting narrative nonfiction, and I appreciated the fodder for reflection on my upcoming year.

*Putting Education to Work* feels like a sequel to *More Than a Dream*, so it feels appropriate to have read it as the service year is winding down. Where *More Than a Dream* tells the story of the original Cristo Rey high school, *Putting Education to Work* is concerned with the Cristo Rey Network of schools and its national impact. *Putting Education to Work* reads less like narrative nonfiction and more like a policy paper, which makes the book somewhat dull. However, since itâ€™s a short book (six chapters; less than 250 pages), I finished it before it really began to feel tiresome. 

For a brief, readable, academic introduction to Cristo Rey schools, *Putting Education to Work* fits the bill. However, I would recommend the average reader first read *More Than a Dream* and then pick up *Putting Education to Work* as a detailed afterword.
