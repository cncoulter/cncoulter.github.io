D. Watkins grew up in East Baltimore amid drugs, addicts, dealers, and gun violence. After his dope-dealing brother died, he inherited enough cocaine and heroin to put together a crew and start dealing. *The Cook Up* tells his story of getting into—and eventually getting out of—the game.

This book is great. If you are at all interested in Baltimore, racism, inner-city problems, the social effects of drugs, or cultures radically different than the middle-class suburban Catholicism that I knew growing up, go read this book. It’s well written, and it gives you a great story with which to better understand the culture of drugs and guns that thrives in East and West Baltimore.

Once you’ve read *The Cook Up*, go read *The Beast Side: Living and Dying While Black in America*, also by D. Watkins. *The Beast Side* is short collection of insightful essays addressing everything from Instagram and vegetables to gentrification and Freddie Gray. The essays in *The Beast Side* usually open with a slice-of-life story from Watkins’ life in East Baltimore and then offer an insight on larger social/political issues. I read *The Beast Side* earlier this year, and I definitely enjoyed it. However, I think that I read D. Watkins’ books in the wrong order; I think I’d appreciate *The Beast Side* more after having read *The Cook Up*. This is simply because once you read *The Cook Up*, you have a lot of context with which to better understand the essays in *The Beast Side*. *The Beast Side* certainly stands on its own; I just think the greater context would yield a richer reading experience.

Also, D. Watkins knows how to write well. Both books are written accessibly; the chapters/essays are short, the vocabulary is simply/accessible, and D. Watkins quickly hooked my attention in each chapter/essay.
